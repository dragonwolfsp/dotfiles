<h1>Custom Notifications</h1>

<ul>
<li>A checkbox to choose if notifications should be truncated, checked by default.</li>
<li>An edit box to set the start limit of notifications, empty by default.</li>
<li>An edit box to set the end limit of notifications, ", " (comma space) by default.</li>
<li>A list of checkboxes to select if notifications should be spoken and displayed in braille, both checked by default.</li>
<li>An edit box to type a text to send a test notification, to get an idea of how NVDA will present toasts.</li>
<li>If the previous edit box contains text, a button to send a notification, so you can test if your selected  settings work fine for you.</li>
