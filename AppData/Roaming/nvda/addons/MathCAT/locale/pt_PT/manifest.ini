summary = "MathCAT: fala e braille a partir de MathML"
description = """MathCAT is a replacement for MathPlayer which has been discontinued.
        It provides speech and braille support, and also supports MathPlayer's three modes of navigation.
        The speech quality is not quite as good as MathPlayer's speech yet,
        but the braille support is much better and includes support for Nemeth, UEB Technical, CMU (Spanish/Portuguese),
        and Vietnamese braille code standards. Translations to Chinese (Traditional), Indonesian, Spanish, and Vietnamese exist
        and other translations are in progress."""
