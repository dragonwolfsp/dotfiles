<h1>Nao - NVDA Advanced OCR</h1>
<ul>
<li>Authors: Alessandro Albano, Davide De Carne, Simone Dal Maso</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://nvda-nao.org/download">stable version</a></li>
<li>NVDA compatibility: 2019.3 and beyond</li>
</ul>
<p>Nao (NVDA Advanced OCR) is an addon that improves the standard OCR capabilities that NVDA provides on modern Windows versions.
While NVDA standard command uses Windows OCR to recognize the screen, NAO is able to make the OCR on files saved on your hard drive or USB devices or attached to e-mails. 
Use NVDA-Shift-R to recognize any sorts of images and pdf! 
Simply put the focus / cursor on the file you desire, don't open it, but hit NVDA-Shift-r. 
The document will be recognized and a simple text window will appear, allowing you to read the entire content, save it, find text or copy content to clipboard.
Nao is able to handle also multipage pdf, so if you have a not accessible document, don't worry, Windows OCR will be able to make the entire work.</p>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>The addon works on Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems, since they have OCR capabilities builtin. 
Nao is compatible from NVDA version 2019.3, so don't use older versions of the screen reader.
Note that Nao works with Windows Explorer, on desktop, with Total Commander or xplorerÂ² filemanager; don't use other software like 7zip or Winrar, since they are not supported.
For e-mail attachments, it also works with Microsoft Outlook 2016 or beyond.</p>
<h2>Features and commands</h2>
<ul>
<li>NVDA + Shift + R: recognize any sorts of images and pdf from file system or attached to an e-mail;</li>
<li>PgUp / PgDown: move the cursor between real pages of a multipages document.</li>
<li>Ctrl + S: save the document in nao-document format. You can open it again with NVDA + Shift + R.</li>
<li>P: report page number related to the cursor position, in a multipage document.</li>
<li>L: report line number at the cursor position, related to the current page.</li>
<li>Shift + L: report line number at the cursor position, related to the whole document.</li>
<li>G: go directly on a certain page.</li>
<li>C: copy all text to the clipboard.</li>
<li>S: save a copy of the document in text format.</li>
<li>F: find text and read some words before and after the string.</li>
<li>NVDA + Shift + Ctrl + R: take a full screen shot and recognize it.</li>
<li>Please note that you can use standard NVDA commands to explore window and bring focus to an element. For example you can move with arrow keys and press enter in a button to activate it. You can also bring the mouse to your position with NVDA-numpad slash and then click with left/right keys.</li>
<li>NVDA + Shift + Ctrl + W: take a screen shot of the current window and recognize it (same navigation features of the full screen shot function).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can customize shortcuts of Nao simply from the input gestures dialog of NVDA. Open NVDA menu, go to preferences, and from that submenu select input gestures dialog. Remember that this feature is not global, but it works only where Nao can make an ocr. So gestures will appear only if you are in the desktop, or in file explorer, Total Commander or Xplorer.</p>
<p>You can also abort a long Ocr process simply pressing "Cancel" from the progress bar window; this window also gives you information about the state of the OCR, updating informations every 5 seconds. You can configure how to receive progress bar information with the standard NVDA-u command.</p>
<p>You can find a submenu named Nao, under the NVDA - Tools - menu. For the moment it contains only an item that allow you to make a donation, but we will improve that with new features!</p>

<p>Nao is absolutely free. Anyway, please remember that this addon is made during spare time of developers.
